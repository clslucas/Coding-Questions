## Problem Statement
This year Chef is participating in a Dancing competition. The dance performance will be done on a linear stage marked with integral positions. Initially, Chef is present at position X and Chef's dance partner is at position Y. Chef can perform two kinds of dance moves.

If Chef is currently at position k, Chef can:

Moonwalk to position k+2, or
Slide to position kâˆ’1
Chef wants to find the minimum number of moves required to reach his partner. Can you help him find this number?

## Input Format
* First line will contain a single integer T, the number of testcases. Then the description of T testcases follows.
* Each testcase contains a single line with two space-separated integers X,Y, representing the initial positions of Chef and his dance partner, respectively.

## Output Format
For each testcase, print in a separate line, a single integer, the minimum number of moves required by Chef to reach his dance partner.
